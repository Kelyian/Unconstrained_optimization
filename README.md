Unconstrained Optimization in Python

Python implementations of common unconstrained optimization methods:

**Steepest Descent
**Newton's Method
**Quasi-Newton Methods
**Gauss-Newton Method
**Linear Conjugate Gradient

Usage

-Import the method.
-Define your function, gradient, and (if needed) Hessian/Jacobian.
-Call the optimizer with an initial guess.
